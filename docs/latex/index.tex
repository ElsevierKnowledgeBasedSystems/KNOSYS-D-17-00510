\subsection*{Description\+: }

L\+I\+B\+I\+R\+W\+LS is an integrated library that incorporates a parallel implementation of the Iterative Re-\/\+Weighted Least Squares (I\+R\+W\+LS) procedure, an alternative to quadratic programming (QP), for training of Support Vector Machines (S\+V\+Ms). Although there are several methods for S\+VM training, the number of parallel libraries is very reduced. In particular, this library contains solutions to solve either full or budgeted S\+V\+Ms making use of shared memory parallelization techniques\+:

{\bfseries A parallel S\+VM training procedure based on the I\+R\+W\+LS algorithm.}

{\bfseries A parallel budgeted S\+V\+Ms solver based on the I\+R\+W\+LS algorithm.}

For a detailed explanation of the algorithms take a look at the \href{https://robedm.github.io/LIBIRWLS/}{\tt web page}



\subsection*{Motivation }

S\+V\+Ms are a very popular machine learning technique because they can easily create non-\/linear solutions by transforming the input space onto a high dimensional one where a kernel function can compute the inner product of a pair vectors. Thanks to this ability, they offer a good compromise between complexity and performance in many applications.

S\+V\+Ms have two main limitations. The first problem is related to their non-\/parametric nature. The complexity of the classifier is not limited and depends on the number of Support Vectors (S\+Vs) after training. If the number of S\+Vs is very large we may obtain a very slow classifier when processing new samples. The second problem is the run time associated to the training procedure that may be excessive for large datasets.

To face these problems, we can make use of parallel computing, thus reducing the run time of the training procedure or we can use budgeted approximations than can limit the complexity of the model in advance, which directly implies a faster classifier.

The above situation motivated us to develop \char`\"{}\+L\+I\+B\+I\+R\+W\+L\+S\char`\"{}, an integrated library based on a parallel implementation of the I\+R\+W\+LS procedure to solve non-\/linear S\+V\+Ms, either full and budgeted. This library is implemented in C, supports a wide range of platforms and also provides detailed information about its programming interface and dependencies.
